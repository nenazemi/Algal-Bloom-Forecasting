### Algal-Bloom-Forecasting
Algae are a critical part of aquatic food webs, but they can become overabundant and form blooms under certain conditions.
Blooms can intoxicate drinking water, cause illness or even death if consumed by animals or people. The blooms can also cause fish kills by drawing down oxygen to deficient levels. Recreation can also be affected by toxic blooms or just because no one wants to swim in scummy green water. For the same reason, increasing the abundance of algae also leads to decreases in property values.
So all of that explains what algal blooms are and why they are bad, but how does algal bloom forecasting help?  We still live by and rely on these water bodies, and in those cases, near-term bloom forecasting could be a practical tool for management. A bloom forecast looks the same as the weather forecasts you see every day look like, except instead of predicting whether itâ€™s going to be rainy or sunny or cloudy, we are predicting if the water will be clear or filled with algae, and to what extent. Accurate predictions could give managers time to take proactive actions. Many seafood industries, local government agencies, and recreational sites at beaches directly benefit from the bloom forecasting tool.
This project aims to leverage high-frequency lake data to develop a real-time algal bloom forecasting tool. The data set that I will use for this project is an open-source dataset for lake Mendota located in Wisconsin.
 The dataset contains the water quality and weather variables for 2343 days over 13 years (2006-2018). This dataset has varying frequencies; therefore, careful data pre-processing is required to create a standard and consistent data frame for further model development and evaluation. Exploratory analysis is also necessary to clean outliers and missing values.
So far, I have combined different datasets, did a substantial preprocessing to find outliers, treat missing values, and eventually created a single dataset with consistent daily frequency.
I also developed a sequential deep learning model. I trained this model for 2006-2017 and tested it on 2018 data. Comparing the forecasted data versus actual observation and a persistence model as a naive model supports my idea that deep learning models can help develop a real-time forecasting tool for the algal bloom.
